- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WesselKonstantinov
- ðŸ’ª I recently finished learning Full-stack Development @ [https://www.wincacademy.nl](https://www.wincacademy.nl/#). 
- ðŸ‘€ My profile consists of projects and exercises I made as part of the curriculum along with a few of my own.
- ðŸŒ± I will keep building various projects and am currently working on a basic CRUD app using Flask and React.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm currently looking for an employer in order to build working experience as a junior developer.
